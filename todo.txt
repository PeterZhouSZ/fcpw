Priority:
1. implement mbvh/qbvh
---- enable embree with enoki
---- enoki settings on ubuntu (geometry-box)
2. add support for more geometries:
---- line segments (3d), beziers (3d), implicits (spheres & boxes)
3. option to ignore certain primitives
4. benchmark
5. travis CI

Optimizations and Features:
1. vectorize + parallelize bvh construction
2. support oriented bounding boxes/RSS
3. traversal optimization for closest point queries:
---- implement "queueless" closest point traversal
---- (for non-spatio-temporal (incoherent) queries) incrementally build spatial data
	  structure that stores pointers to nodes in the tree; bvh populates spatial data
	  structure while spatial data structure suggests which node to start queries from
4. traversal optimization for intersections:
---- implement "stackless" ray intersection traversal
---- (for non-spatio-temporal (incoherent) queries) incrementally build spatial data
	  structure that stores pointers to nodes in the tree; unlike closest point queries,
	  data structure(s) must store positions and directions
5. add support for more geometries:
---- subdivision surfaces, implicits, nurbs
6. packet (coherent) queries
---- breadth first ray tracing
7. refit bvh
