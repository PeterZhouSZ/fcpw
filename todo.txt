- implement mbvh/qbvh
- traversal optimization for closest point queries:
-- (for spatio-temporially related queries) warm start traversal from node of
	previous query, traversing hierarchy bottom up; distance from previous query can
	be use to determine whether this is a good idea (it is a good idea when the
	conservative radius guess is small compared to the model size)
-- (for non-spatio-temporially related queries) build spatial data structure that
	stores pointers to nodes in the tree
-- implement "queueless" closest point traversal
- traversal optimization for intersections:
-- smarter traversal for incoherent rays (?)
-- implement "stackless" ray intersection traversal
- oriented bounding boxes/RSS
- add support for more geometries:
-- line segments (3d), beziers (3d), subdivision surfaces, implicits, nurbs
- vectorize + parallelize bvh construction
- packet (coherent) queries
- refit bvh
