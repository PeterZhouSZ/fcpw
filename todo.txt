- implement mbvh/qbvh
-- enable embree with enoki
-- enoki settings on ubuntu (geometry-box)
- traversal optimization for closest point queries:
-- (for spatio-temporal (coherent) queries) warm start traversal from node of
	previous query, traversing hierarchy bottom up; distance from previous query result
	can be use to determine whether this is a good idea (it is a good idea when the
	conservative radius guess is small compared to the model size); (done for sbvh)
-- (for non-spatio-temporal (incoherent) queries) incrementally build spatial data
	structure that stores pointers to nodes in the tree; bvh populates spatial data
	structure while spatial data structure suggests which node to start queries from
-- implement "queueless" closest point traversal
- traversal optimization for intersections:
-- smarter traversal for incoherent rays using similar ideas to closest point queries;
	but need to take ray origin and direction into account
-- implement "stackless" ray intersection traversal
- oriented bounding boxes/RSS
- add support for more geometries:
-- line segments (3d), beziers (3d), subdivision surfaces, implicits, nurbs
- vectorize + parallelize bvh construction
- packet (coherent) queries
-- breadth first ray tracing
- refit bvh
- add CI
